# rc-incoming-web-hook-test
Small project for incoming web hooks in rocketchat.

Just a dummy script for posting the content of the payload of the web hook and an example of another very simple script test for helping building simple scripts loccaly.

The idea in general if you dont know the payload of the incoming request is to use the check script for seeing it posted in RC. After you can paste the json into the test script and start creating and testing your script.
